// This is a list of unsolved Problems

// In Python
// Create a way to receive the results of morse code, but also be able to give possible results 
//      if the morse code has ?, where the . or - is not necessarily heard. This translator should be
//      used for any amount of characters up to a reasonable amount.
//      example would be decodeMorse('.... . -.--   .--- ..- -.. .') -> this returns HEY JUDE
//      example would be decodeMorse('?... . -.--   .--- ..- -.. .') -> this returns either HEY JUDE or VEY JUDE
//      for robustness let's assume you could give the user the top 100 possibilities, if there ever are that many.


// In C#
// Create a way for you to check between two dates WITHOUT using a DateTime object.


// In C++
// Ther are 3 parameters for this function. 
//    n represents a count. 
//    n_multiple represents a number where you check to see if it is a multiple of the count
//    n_equal represents a number where you check to see if it equals the count
//    Create a way to count to 1 to n without using a loop. 
//    Check to see if it is a multiple of n, and if so skip some counting to where your counter is now equal to counter + n_multiple. 
//    Check to see if n equals n_equal and if it does then end the count immediately
//    example call count_to_n(n, n_multiple, n_equal) should return 1 to n with the checks so if you put in
//    count_to_n(5, 0, 3) then the results would be 1, 2, 3
//    count_to_n(5, 1, 999) then the results would be 1, 3, 5
